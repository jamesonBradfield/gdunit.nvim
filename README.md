    })
  end,
}
Using packer.nvim
lua

## Usage
### Commands
```
:GdUnit run - Run tests for the current file
:GdUnit runAll - Run all tests in the project
:GdUnit runWithConfig [file] - Run tests with a specific config file
:GdUnit create - Generate a test file for the current C# class
:GdUnit open - Open the latest test report
:GdUnit reload - Reload the plugin (useful during development)
:GdUnit debug - Toggle debug mode
:GdUnit show_config - Display current configuration
```
### Creating Tests

1. Open a C# class file in your Godot project
2. Run :GdUnit create
3. The plugin will generate a test file in the test directory
4. Open the generated test file to customize it

### Running Tests

1. Open a test file
2. Run :GdUnit run to execute the current test
3. Results will be displayed in a floating window
4. Use :GdUnit runAll to run all tests in your project

### Test Results

Test results are displayed in a floating window with syntax highlighting:

    ‚úì Passed tests are highlighted in green
    ‚úó Failed tests are highlighted in red
    Detailed error information is shown for failed tests

If you have snacks.nvim installed, the results window will use its enhanced UI.
